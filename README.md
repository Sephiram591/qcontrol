# qcontrol
A package for emulating the control of color center qubits.

Note that this is pip installable, go to the qubit-control directory, activate your desired conda environment, and enter the following command:
python -m pip install -e .  
This will pip install the current directory with the 'editable' flag. Every time the kernel restarts (or by using autoreload), you can load any updates to make to the package without pip installing again.
